        # An Introduction to Myst

        Welcome! In this guide, we'll be going through a tour of the Myst language, including syntax, terminology, some of the standard library, best practices, and more.

        All of that will be covered in the sections that follow. This section, however, is focused on laying a foundation for the rest of the guide to build upon.


        ## Installing Myst

        If you'd like to follow along and try out the sample code provided throughout this guide, you'll need to have Myst installed on your machine. See the [Installation guide](https://github.com/myst-lang/myst#installation) for details on how to get set up.

        Note that Myst currently does not work on Windows machines. This has to do with how the language is implemented, and is something that is actively being worked on. Sorry to all the Windows users out there. Hopefully we will have an update for you soon.


        ## Sample Code

        Throughout this guide, you'll see a lot of code samples that you should be able to copy and run for yourself to try things out. For example:

        ~~~myst
        IO.puts("Hello, world!")
        ~~~

        In a lot of cases, where a particular value is expected, you'll also see a `#=>` followed by some text inside the code sample. This is meant to help indicate the expected behavior of the code. For example:

        ~~~myst
        1 + 2 #=> 3
        ~~~

        This sample shows that the expected result of `1 + 2` is `3`. Note that this style doesn't actually have any effect in the code (the `#` indicates that the rest of the line is a comment), and is simply a helpful tool, particularly for complex examples.


        ## Asking Questions

        This guide isn't perfect, and makes some assumptions about prior knowledge that might not be accurate for everyone, but that's okay! Having questions and asking them is an important part of learning.

        If you do have a question, the best place to ask is in the [Myst Language discord server](http://discord.myst-lang.org/). There's an entire channel dedicated to asking questions, and an entire community to help answer them.

        The questions people ask are an important part in helping us improve this guide. So, no matter how simple your question may feel, _ask it anyway_.

        -----

        With all that out of the way, let's get started! Head on to [Chapter 1](/get-started/chapter1.html) whenever you're ready.

        Welcome to Myst!
